# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification 🌸

## 📝 Project Overview

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species are :

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

The classification is based on the unique combination of four key features for each flower, which are used to predict the species.

## 📊 Dataset

The **Iris Dataset** contains 150 instances of iris flowers, with 50 instances for each of the three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Each instance contains the following four features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

These features are used for training and testing the model.

## 🛠️ Model Development

The Jupyter notebook `Iris_Flower_classification.ipynb` contains the following key steps:

### Data Loading and Preprocessing:

1. **Load the dataset**
2. **Implement the KNN classifier**
3. **Model Evaluation: Achieved 100% accuracy**
4. **Save the model for deployment purposes**
5. **connecting to web interface using flask**
6. **deploying the model using AWS EC2 Instance**
